What is an 'Account Balance'
An account balance is the amount of money in a financial repository, such as a checking account, at any given moment. It can also be the total amount of money owed to a third party such as a credit card company, utility company, mortgage banker or other type of lender or creditor. The account balance is always the net amount after factoring in all debits and credits.

BREAKING DOWN 'Account Balance'
For example, with a credit card, a person may have made purchases of $100, $50 and $25,
 and returned an item costing $10. The account balance includes the purchases he made, ]
 which total $175, but also the item he returned for $10. The net of the debits and credits is $165, or $175 minus $10, and that amount is the account balance.
Finding Your Account Balance in Banking
In banking, the account balance is the amount of money an individual has available in his 
checking or savings account. The account balance is the net amount available to the person
 after all deposits and credits have been balanced with any charges or debits.
 Sometimes an account balance does not reflect the most accurate representation 
 of an individual's available money, due to pending transactions or checks that have not been processed.
